Ignite's ReactJs track project in production...

Project created in NextJs and Typescript

The application is fullstack and its main features are:

- be able to authenticate with google or github - OAuth was used for this
- being able to create book reviews - for this, routes (api routes) were created within NextJs
- being able to track information about how many books were read, most read categories, etc., on the Profile page - Javascript was used to perform the calculations
- search for books on the Explorer page and follow the evaluation of other users - again possible due to the routes (api routes) that were created inside the frontend

Some technologies used to create the application:

- NextJs - use of Next functions like getServerSideProps
- Typescript - to create the types of objects, variables, constants, functions
- stitches - to create components, styles, themes, animations
